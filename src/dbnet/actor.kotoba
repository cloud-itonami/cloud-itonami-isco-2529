  "DatabaseNetworkProfessionalsActor — the ISCO-08 2529 community dbnet actor as a
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section). One graph run = one dbnet operation request
  (intake → advise → govern → decide → commit/hold, with a
  human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite
  internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can
  resume after human sign-off. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-2411's
  accounting.actor.

  The unconditional invariant: the DatabaseNetworkProfessionalsAdvisor can never
  directly commit a record the DatabaseNetworkProfessionalsGovernor refuses —
  every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`."
